<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Big data is a field that treats ways to analyze, systematically extract information from, or otherwise deal with data sets that are too large or complex to be dealt with by traditional data-processing application software. Data with many cases (rows) offer greater statistical power, while data with higher complexity (more attributes or columns) may lead to a higher false discovery rate.<br> Big data challenges include capturing data, data storage, data analysis, search, sharing, transfer, visualization, querying, updating, information privacy and data source.<br> Big data was originally associated with three key concepts: volume, variety, and velocity.<br> When we handle big data, we may not sample but simply observe and track what happens.<br> Therefore, big data often includes data with sizes that exceed the capacity of traditional software to process within an acceptable time and value.</p>

      <h3>Definitions</h3>

      <p>The term has been in use since the 1990s, with some giving credit to John Mashey for popularizing the term.<br> Big data usually includes data sets with sizes beyond the ability of commonly used software tools to capture, curate, manage, and process data within a tolerable elapsed time.<br> Big data philosophy encompasses unstructured, semi-structured and structured data, however the main focus is on unstructured data.<br> Big data "size" is a constantly moving target, as of 2012 ranging from a few dozen terabytes to many zettabytes of data.<br> Big data requires a set of techniques and technologies with new forms of integration to reveal insights from data-sets that are diverse, complex, and of a massive scale.<br> "Variety", "veracity" and various other "Vs" are added by some organizations to describe it, a revision challenged by some industry authorities.<br> A 2018 definition states "Big data is where parallel computing tools are needed to handle data", and notes, "This represents a distinct and clearly defined change in the computer science used, via parallel programming theories, and losses of some of the guarantees and capabilities made by Codd's relational model."</p>
